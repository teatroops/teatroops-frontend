      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        The prices on our website are all subject to change, but they won't have an impact on orders that we have already accepted. Shipping and VAT are not included in the prices listed on our website; these will be added at the time of checkout. Our website lists the carefully calculated prices of our products. But if the goods you bought has been priced wrongly owing to inadvertent mistakes, we will let you know by phone or email before we accept your order so you can get the proper information.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[--primary-color] mb-4">Shelf Life and Storage Conditions</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        The tea we offer is good for 24 months after purchase. We are able to achieve such a long shelf life because of our superior vacuum technique and packing materials. Please take into account the storage conditions for tea in order to fully appreciate its extended shelf life. Tea should be kept in airtight containers away from heat, moisture, and odors from food. It needs to be kept somewhere dry and cool. Since freezing can shorten the tea's shelf life, we do not advise it.
      </p>
